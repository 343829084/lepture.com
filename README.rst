Just lepture
=============

Hi, I am **Hsiaoming Young** (aka **lepture** elsewhere).

I am a creative web developer, fan of python. I love everything that worth the word beauty.

I did, do and will always belive in "Love its people, but never trust its government".


I blog about life and work.
All posts about life are written in Chinese which is my mother tongue. 
Posts about my work may written in English, but I will take no responsibility for its readibility.
