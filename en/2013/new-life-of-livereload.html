    <p>I created <a href="https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload">livereload</a>
(implemented in Python) one year and 8 months ago. The first version was
released on May 4th, 2012. I had been working on it for a while, but I
didn't enjoy it myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a> is a Mac software that monitors
changes in the file system. A quote from the official website:</p>
<blockquote><p>As soon as you save a file, it is preprocessed as needed, and the browser
is refreshed.</p>
</blockquote><p>And my implementation in Python is a command line tool that simulates the
behavior of LiveReload, a bit like <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">guard</a>.</p>
<p>The reason why I created this project is pretty simple. I was working in a
Python-only development environment, it would be nice that everything is
in Python. However, things changed in the last year, I am more a front end
developer than a back end pythonist. I enjoy nodejs, I also enjoy other
languages like ruby and golang.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't like to start another server for watching file changes only,
the original design of Guardfile is not good enough, at least I am not
satisfied. The simulation just doesn't work for me.</p>
<blockquote class="cite-quote"><p>most things have some design behind,
as people copy it, the original design gets obscured and forgotten,
the original design might no longer apply</p>
<cite>Armin Ronacher</cite>
</blockquote><p>This is a slide of a talk by Armin Ronacher — <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mitsuhiko/thinking-outside-the-box">Thinking Outside The Box</a>.</p>
<h2>Create something I will use in the daily life</h2>
<p>The original copied one has nothing new, nothing special for Python that
I would use it in my daily life. This makes me sad. So I have no much
enthusiasm in the maintainence of it.</p>
<p>But I do believe that livereload is a good idea. Maybe I just did it wrong.
One day, a brilliant idea came to me — livereload for wsgi.</p>
<p>A simple example of the idea:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">livereload</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Server</span>

<span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Server</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">wsgi_app</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">watch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;static/app.css&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Wow, that looks good. It seems something that I will use in my daily life.
Since I prefer Flask, I can write the scripts with Flask-Script in a
<code>manage.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">create_app</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="nd">@manager.command</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">liveserver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">livereload</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Server</span>
    <span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Server</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wsgi_app</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">watch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;static/*.css&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And whenenver a css file changes, the browser will refresh it itself.</p>
<p>Actually, my environment of front end development is far more complex,
I use rework for css processing, component for javascript modular. The
real example would be gorgeous.</p>
<p>Take a peep of my scripts:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@manager.command</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">liveserver</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5000</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">livereload</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Server</span>

    <span class="n">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Server</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wsgi_app</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">watch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;assets/styles/*.css&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;make -C assets rework&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">watch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;assets/lib/*.js&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;make -C assets build&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">watch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;app/templates&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<h2>Do one job, and do it well</h2>
<p>Version 2.0 of livereload is more a library rather than an application.
Which means other libraries in Python can easily bundle it in. I hope it
can be a great library.</p>
<p>The executable command line tool is removed from livereload. It may come
back again, but not soon. The compilers like uglifyjs, lesscss, slim,
CoffeeScript are removed from livereload too.</p>
<p>For now, livereload will focus on one thing — livereload. And livereload
well.</p>
<p>The lack of compilers does not affect much. Since livereload provides you
a way to execute shell command. As you can see in the above example that
<code>server.watch</code> supports executing shell commands, so that we can do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">watch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;src/foo.js&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;uglifyjs src/foo.js -m -o build/foo.js&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That's why compilers are removed, since every compiler is some sort of a
shell command, there is no reason for wrapping them in Python any more.</p>
<p>By removing compilers, livereload focuses on the server implementation,
and file watcher. The core code is much simple now.</p>
<h2>Take advantage of existed tools</h2>
<p>We programers like to reinvent tools. Sometimes we create things better
than the old ones, sometimes we fail. The most valuable tool I learned
in the last two years is Makefile.</p>
<p>I think every programer should know Makefile, and take the advantage of
it. Like what I did/do in my daily life. The examples above are using
Makefile:</p>
<pre><code>server.watch(&#39;assets/styles/*.css&#39;, &#39;make -C assets rework&#39;)</code></pre>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>The rewritted version 2.0 of livereload was released days ago. There are
features not implmented, bugs not fixed, but the concept works well. It
is not just an implementation <strong>of Python</strong>, it is an implementation
<strong>for Python</strong>.</p>
<p>The code is much more pretty than before. It is well documented and tested.
I hope people will enjoy it. It is a library now, I am looking forward to
libraries that depend on this project and making the web development of
more fun.</p>
