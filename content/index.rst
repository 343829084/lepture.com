About this Website
-------------------

I have tried lots of blog platforms, and have written some blog platforms, and I hope this is
the very end of it.

It's now powered by `Felix Felicis </project/liquidluck>`_ which is a static blog generator
by me, written in python. It's not perfect, but I wrote it, I can improve it. The source code
of this site can be found at `Github Blog Source <https://github.com/lepture/lepture.com>`_ .

If you are interested in this project, you should check this article `Mechanism of Felix Felicis <http://lepture.com/work/mechanism-of-liquidluck/>`_
