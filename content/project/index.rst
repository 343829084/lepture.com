Vealous
-----------
`Vealous <https://github.com/lepture/Vealous>`_ is a blog system for GAE.

I stopped this project long ago, I think it's quite a briliant decision since Google has changed the price plan.

But if you still have a faith in GAE, you can fork this project, and continue my work.


Feedbundle
-----------
Create a bundle of your favorite feeds with `Feedbundle <http://www.feedbundle.com>`_, but I have no spare time right now, I will continue this project when I am free.

The project is written with tornado_ , database powered by mongodb.
