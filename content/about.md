## Hsiaoming Yang

Hi! My name is **Hsiaoming Young** (aka **lepture** elsewhere).

I am a creative web developer, fan of python. I love everything that worth the word beauty.
I am currently living in Hangzhou, employed as a front end developer at Alipay.

I did, do and will always believe in **Love its people, but never trust its government**.

## Just lepture

I have tried lots of blog platforms, and have written some blog platforms, and I hope this is
the very end of it.

It is now powered by [Felix Felicis](http://project.lepture.com/liquidluck/)
which is a static blog generator by me, written in python. It is not perfect, 
but I wrote it, I can improve it. The source code of this site can be found at 
[Github](https://github.com/lepture/lepture.com>).

If you are interested in this project, you should check this article
