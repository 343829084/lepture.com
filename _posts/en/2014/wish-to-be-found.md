I also remember what I asked the Moon Lady so long ago. I wished to be found.

*This is a English translation of [a Chinese story](/zh/2014/wish-to-be-found), but not literally translated.*

I love the story of *The Moon Lady* in *The Joy Luck Club* by Amy Tan, it brings me one of my most touching memories.

> I remember all these things. And tonight, on the fifteenth day of the eighth moon, I also remember what I asked the Moon Lady so long ago. I wished to be found.

I can't remember the exact day which the story happened. Maybe it was in Summer, maybe it was in the early Autumn. But I do remember the shiny sunlight that day.

The day in my elementary school was over. We, me and my little brother, went home. Only to find that no one was at home. We searched the lintel of the door for the keys, but in vain.
